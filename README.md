## Call summary

```sh
$ forge test -vv -m invariant_callSummary
```

```sh
Running 1 test for test/WETH9.invariants.t.sol:WETH9Invariants
[PASS] invariant_callSummary() (runs: 1000, calls: 15000, reverts: 11)
Logs:
  Call summary:
  deposit 5
  withdraw 7
  sendFallback 3

Test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; finished in 4.42s
```

Although we performed 1000 runs, the summary printed here is a snapshot of calls made during the final run.

The total number of calls in our summary should always be the same as the depth parameter set for invariant tests in foundry.toml

## Reusing actors

```sh
Running 1 test for test/WETH9.invariants.t.sol:WETH9Invariants
[PASS] invariant_callSummary() (runs: 2000, calls: 50000, reverts: 2)
Logs:
  Call summary:
  deposit 5
  withdraw 8
  sendFallback 12
  zero withdrawals 3

```

## Including transfers

Note that we call `bound` twice in `transferFrom` to ensure the transfer value is less than the `from` account's balance and that `currentActor` has a sufficient allowance to perform the third-party transfer.

If you look carefully at this, you may notice we have a similar problem to the zero amount issue we just solved for `withdraw`: even though we're reusing known callers, most of the time `amount` will be zero, since it's unlikely the `caller` has an approval from the `from` account. (You can use the same call summary process to debug yourself if you're interested).

```sh
Running 5 tests for test/WETH9.invariants.t.sol:WETH9Invariants
[PASS] invariant_callSummary() (runs: 1000, calls: 25000, reverts: 49)
[PASS] invariant_conservationOfETH() (runs: 1000, calls: 25000, reverts: 49)
[PASS] invariant_depositorBalances() (runs: 1000, calls: 25000, reverts: 49)
[PASS] invariant_solvencyBalances() (runs: 1000, calls: 25000, reverts: 49)
[PASS] invariant_solvencyDeposits() (runs: 1000, calls: 25000, reverts: 49)
Test result: ok. 5 passed; 0 failed; finished in 21.35s
```

## Testing our tests

We can introduce bugs manually like so:

```javascript
    function deposit() public payable {
        // balanceOf[msg.sender] += msg.value;
        balanceOf[msg.sender] += 1;
        emit Deposit(msg.sender, msg.value);
    }
```
